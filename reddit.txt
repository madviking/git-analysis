Being a data nerd, I wanted to understand from my own codebases, how LLM adoption has affected my code volume. I know volumetric measurements are poor at best, but it is very hard to quantify the effect in any other way.

So in order to scan the numerous repos I work with, I built a small tool for it, but then started thinking this might be interesting information to collect and compare with others. I created this tiny prototype of visualising statistics to be uploaded by the tool:

[https://v0-llm-git-inflection.vercel.app/](https://v0-llm-git-inflection.vercel.app/)

What do you think would be **MUST** to include for you to upload your own (anonymous) statistics? And other than full transparency and possibility to be fully anonymous, what else should I consider?

For reference, here is some data when I started using LLM's (June 2025). So comparing H1 and H2 of 2025. Big "bootstrap" type inserts are ignored from the stats.

**Change from my inflection point**

|Metric|2025H1|2025H2|Δ|Δ%|

|Deletions|377,805|989,525|\+611,720|\+161.9%|

**Changes in my language usage**

|PHP|65,783|1,532|\-64,251|\-97.7%|

**Some other interesting findings**

* \+227.1% increase in test code
* 130k doc line changes (up from some hundreds)
* Huge increase in different kinds of cli-helpers
* Deletions increase is surprisingly well in line with insertions increase = less code rot than I expected
